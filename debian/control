Description: k-mer spectrum-based read error corrector
 Bloocoo is a k-mer spectrum-based read error corrector, designed to correct 
 large datasets with a very low memory footprint. It uses the disk streaming 
 k-mer counting algorithm contained in the GATB library, and inserts solid 
 k-mers in a bloom-filter. The correction procedure is similar to the Musket 
 multistage approach. Bloocoo yields similar results while requiring far 
 less memory: as an example, it can correct whole human genome re-sequencing 
 reads at 70 x coverage with less than 4GB of memory.
